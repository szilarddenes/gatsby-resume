  summary: 
  -  Once a geologist engineer in the hydrocarbon industry, I discovered my love for programming in high school, which I brought to my work as a geologist, where I utilized my analytical mindset to streamline tasks and solve complex problems.
  - I excelled in automating repetitive tasks and problem-solving through the use of datasets and variables. In 2018, I reignited my passion for programming, creating my own webshop and other websites such as munkaportal.ro, gpoauto.ro, and jointadventure.com. I also joined a project in VBA Excel scripting and ERP system setup and code (Python) for a company.
  - In July 2022, I decided to take a leap of faith and quit my Budapest-based 9-6 job, embarking on a new journey as a freelancer, balancing my passions for geology and programming. From developing Excel VBA add-ins to website design and coding in VB and C#, I continue to expand my skill set while working with a variety of geology-related companies.
  - Through it all, my personal website and blog, solid.garden, will serve as a platform to share my worldview, coding journey, and the progress of building my future home with my fiancé, our cat, Mr. Carrot, and rescued dog, Henna. With a passion for learning and an open mind to new opportunities, I am excited to see where my unique combination of skills will take me next.

    summary: As a Developer at Geoszféra Kft. I am responsible for revisiting Excel VBA Addons created by a former colleague. My role involves reviewing and modifying the code to ensure that it is functional, efficient, and error-free. To help users understand how to use these add-ons, I also write documentation that explains the purpose, functionality, and usage of each tool.
    highlights:
      - I clean up the existing Excel add-ins to remove any unnecessary code, optimize performance, and make them more user-friendly. This involves restructuring the code, renaming variables, and adding comments to make it easier to read and understand.
      - If necessary, I also rewrite the add-ins in a more modern programming language, such as C#.
      - Throughout my work, I focus on delivering high-quality code and documentation that meets the needs of the end-users. By doing so, I help to ensure that our geotechnical engineering teams have access to the tools they need to do their jobs effectively.
