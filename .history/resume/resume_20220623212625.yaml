  summary:
    - I learned programming in high school, then became a geologist. During my work I used the skill of thinking in datasets and variables, so I could automatize repetitive tasks and solve various technical problems. I have no professional experience in software engineering, but I have the skills of people and team work.
    - I  coding in 2018, building my webshop. Since then that project got abandoned, but many new ones has been born. They're available at my current website and below at ongoing projects part.
    - I learn and build things proactively after work, during nights and mornings. I am opened for any opportunity, where I can learn in a  professional environment, get a mentor, and deep dive in the detailed world of programming.
    - This domain -> Solid means Szilárd. solid.garden will be my blog/personal website, where I share my worldview, the fruits of my coding journey and of my garden / future living area. We have a small plot close to the forest, where we'll built our future home,  together with my feyonce and our cat, Mr. Carrot🥕.
