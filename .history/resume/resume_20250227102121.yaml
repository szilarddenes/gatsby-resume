  summary:
    - Once a geologist engineer in the hydrocarbon industry, I discovered my love for programming in high school, which I brought to my work as a geologist, where I utilized my analytical mindset to streamline tasks and solve complex problems.
    - I excelled in automating repetitive tasks and problem-solving through the use of datasets and variables. In 2018, I reignited my passion for programming, creating my own webshop and other websites such as munkaportal.ro, gpoauto.ro, and jointadventure.com. I also contributed to a corporate project involving VBA Excel scripting and Python-based ERP system implementation.
    - In July 2022, I decided to take a leap of faith and quit my Budapest-based 9-6 job, embarking on a new journey as a freelancer, balancing my passions for geology and programming. From developing Excel VBA add-ins to website design and coding in VB and C#, I continue to expand my skill set while working with a variety of geology-related companies.
    - My personal website, solid.garden, serves as a professional portfolio to showcase my technical skills, project experience, and career development. It functions as both a resume and a progress tracker for my ongoing work. With a passion for learning and an open mind to new opportunities, I look forward to exploring where my unique combination of geological knowledge and programming expertise will lead next.
