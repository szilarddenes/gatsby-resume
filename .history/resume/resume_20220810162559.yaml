  summary:
    - I learned programming in high school, then became a geologist. During my work I used the skill of thinking in datasets and variables, so I could automatize repetitive tasks and solve various technical problems. I have no professional experience in software engineering, but I have the skills of people and team work.
    - I rediscovered my passion for programming in 2018 and built my webshop. Since then that project got abandoned because of Covid, but many new ones have born. They're available at my current website as well as in the section below under "Ongoing Projects".
    - Although I have a 9-to-5 “day job” I am able to take on other projects during evenings and weekends without conflict. I am open to any full time opportunity where I can learn in a  professional environment, get a mentor, and become immersed in the detailed world of programming.
    - "A word on my domain name: Solid means Szilárd. https://solid.garden will be my blog/personal website, where I share my worldview, the fruits of my coding journey and of my garden/future living area. We have a small plot close to the forest, where we'll build our future home,  together with my fiancé and our cat, Mr. Carrot."
