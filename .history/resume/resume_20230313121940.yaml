  summary: 
  -  Once a geologist engineer in the hydrocarbon industry, I discovered my love for programming in high school, which I brought to my work as a geologist, where I utilized my analytical mindset to streamline tasks and solve complex problems.
  - I excelled in automating repetitive tasks and problem-solving through the use of datasets and variables. In 2018, I reignited my passion for programming, creating my own webshop and other websites such as munkaportal.ro, (http://gpoauto.ro/), and [jointadventure.com](http://jointadventure.com/). I also joined a project in VBA Excel scripting and ERP system setup and code (Python) for a company.
  - In July 2022, I decided to take a leap of faith and quit my Budapest-based 9-6 job, embarking on a new journey as a freelancer, balancing my passions for geology and programming. From developing Excel VBA add-ins to website design and coding in VB and C#, I continue to expand my skill set while working with a variety of geology-related companies.
  - Through it all, my personal website and blog, solid.garden, will serve as a platform to share my worldview, coding journey, and the progress of building my future home with my fiancé, our cat, Mr. Carrot, and rescued dog, Henna. With a passion for learning and an open mind to new opportunities, I am excited to see where my unique combination of skills will take me next.
