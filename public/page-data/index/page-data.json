In 2018, I reignited my passion for programming, creating my own webshop and other websites such as munkaportal.ro, gpoauto.ro, and jointadventure.com. I also joined a project in VBA Excel scripting and ERP system setup and code (Python) for a company.","In July 2022, I decided to take a leap of faith and quit my Budapest-based 9-6 job, embarking on a new journey as a freelancer, balancing my passions for geology and programming. From developing Excel VBA add-ins to website design and coding in VB and C#, I continue to expand my skill set while working with a variety of geology-related companies.","Through it all, my personal website and blog, solid.garden, will serve as a platform to share my worldview, coding journey, and the progress of building my future home with my fiancé, our cat, Mr. Carrot, and rescued dog, Henna. With a passion for learning and an open mind to new opportunities, I am excited to see where my unique combination of skills will take me next."],"profiles":[{"network":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/szilarddenes","username":"szilarddenes"},{"network":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/szilarddenes","username":"szilárd dénes"}]},"work":[{"description":"Awesome compression company","endDate":null,"highlights":["loading 2D and 3D seismic surveys into Kingdom software","loading of 2D and 3D gathers","loading any kind of data","performing data quality control","converting coordinates from different UTM zones using QGIS"],"location":"Remote","name":"North American Helium","startDate":"Nov, 2022","position":"Data Entry Specialist","summary":"I specialize in using IHS Kingdom Software to load 2D and 3D seismic surveys, load data, and perform data quality control.
