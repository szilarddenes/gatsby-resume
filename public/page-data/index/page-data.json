During my work I used the skill of thinking in datasets and variables, so I could automatize repetitive tasks and solve various technical problems. I have no professional experience in software engineering, but I have the skills of people and team work.","I rediscovered my passion for programming in 2018 and built my webshop. Since then that project got abandoned because of Covid, but many new ones have born. They're available at my current website as well as in the section below under \"Ongoing Projects\".","Although I have a 9-to-5 “day job” I am able to take on other projects during evenings and weekends without conflict. I am open to any full time opportunity where I can learn in a  professional environment, get a mentor, and become immersed in the detailed world of programming.","A word on my domain name: Solid means Szilárd. https://solid.garden will be my blog/personal website, where I share my worldview, the fruits of my coding journey and of my garden/future living area. We have a small plot close to the forest, where we'll build our future home,  together with my fiancé, our adopted cat: Mr. Carrot, and rescued dog: Henna."],"profiles":[{"network":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/szilarddenes","username":"szilarddenes"},{"network":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/szil%C3%A1rd-d%C3%A9nes-11a00371","username":"szilárd dénes"}]},"work":[{"description":"Awesome compression company","endDate":"Sep, 2022","highlights":["Independently generated an inventory prospects, with several advanced to peer review stage and subsequent approval for drilling.","Handled levels of responsibilities far beyond my experience level","Seismic interpretation, prospect and lead generation plus basic geophysical work  on Hungarian and Romanian assets in team","Completing Petroleum System Analysis (PSA) projects for the OGD's focus areas","Involved in international data rooms and License Round evaluations","Hydrocarbon migration modelling to address the migration risk in the prospect evaluation  process","Data mining, various geodatabase building (excel VBA scripting and ArcGIS)"],"location":"Budapest, HU","name":"O&GD Development Kft","startDate":"Jul, 2015","position":"Exploration Geologist","summary":"Detail-oriented geology work, with multidisciplinary  approach to exploration from basin scale (PSA - Petroleum System Analysis)  to seismic interpretation and prospect generation.
