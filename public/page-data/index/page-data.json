In 2018, I reignited my passion for programming, creating my own webshop and other websites such as munkaportal.ro, gpoauto.ro, and jointadventure.com. I also contributed to a corporate project involving VBA Excel scripting and Python-based ERP system implementation.","In July 2022, I decided to take a leap of faith and quit my Budapest-based 9-6 job, embarking on a new journey as a freelancer, balancing my passions for geology and programming. From developing Excel VBA add-ins to website design and coding in VB and C#, I continue to expand my skill set while working with a variety of geology-related companies.","My personal website, solid.garden, serves as a professional portfolio to showcase my technical skills, project experience, and career development. It functions as both a resume and a progress tracker for my ongoing work. With a passion for learning and an open mind to new opportunities, I look forward to exploring where my unique combination of geological knowledge and programming expertise will lead next."],"location":{"address":"Budai Nagy Antal utca","postalCode":1137,"city":"Budapest","countryCode":"HU","region":"Pest"},"profiles":[{"network":"GitHub","username":"szilarddenes","url":"https://github.com/szilarddenes"},{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"Szilárd Dénes","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/szilarddenes"},{"network":"FreeCodeCamp","username":"szilarddenes","url":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/szilarddenes"}]},"work":[{"description":null,"endDate":null,"highlights":null,"location":"Remote","name":"Mhyner Geoconsulting Kft.","startDate":"Nov, 2024","position":"Exploration Geologist / Developer","summary":"Periodic freelance contributions to the company - providing specialized support for growing initiatives.","url":"http://www.mhyner.com"},{"description":"A petroleum exploration firm focused on seismic interpretation and systematic prospect evaluation for hydrocarbon ranking.","endDate":"Dec, 2024","highlights":["Helped the systematic interpretation of a 500 km² 3D seismic dataset.","Performed quality control on seismic and gather data for accuracy.","Conducted AVO analysis in Paleoscan to evaluate hydrocarbon potential.","Prepared peer review materials, identifying and analyzing key prospect risks.","Evaluated and ranked 12-15 prospects based on hydrocarbon phase and volume.","Delivered detailed volume calculations for prospect assessment."],"location":"Remote","name":"Sand Hill Petroleum BV","startDate":"Apr, 2024","position":"Exploration Geologist","summary":"Undertook a comprehensive interpretation of a new 500 km² 3D seismic dataset, delivering risk analysis, ranking, and peer review materials for multiple prospects.","url":"http://www.shpbv.eu"},{"description":"Awesome compression company","endDate":"Dec, 2023","highlights":["Conducted AVO analysis on several prospects to assess hydrocarbon potential.","Collaborated with interpreters to provide geological insights and support.","Enhanced the geological understanding of prospects for decision-making."],"location":"Remote","name":"O&GD Central Ltd.","startDate":"Oct, 2023","position":"Exploration Geologist","summary":"Provided geological expertise and support in AVO analysis for evaluating multiple prospects.","url":"http://www.shpbv.eu"},{"description":"Awesome compression company","endDate":"Oct, 2023","highlights":["Checked and compared data quality carefully and selected data for AVO analysis","Executed AVO analysis on prospects, including Pre-Stack Intercept vs. Gradient and Post-Stack AVO Attribute plots, while establishing a substantial AVO database encompassing both drilled analogs and potential prospects","Conducted thorough comparisons of prospects with one another and against analogs to predict possible fluid types and address geophysical data issues","Provided valuable geological interpretation support, including the creation of cross-sections, isopach maps, and depositional environment maps within the Area of Interest.","Executed detailed horizon and fault mapping at the prospect scale","Offered crucial support in preparing materials for a Prospect Ranking work","Contributed to the preparation of the Peer Review presentation","Managed and oversaw database operations, including data loading and maintenance"],"location":"Remote","name":"Sand Hill Petroleum BV","startDate":"Jun, 2023","position":"Exploration Geologist","summary":"Played a fundamental role in safeguarding data precision and quality, conducting detailed AVO analysis in IHS Kingdom software, and helping with geological interpretation while managing the project's database effectively.
